sc101-nbd supplies the userland utility and daemon script to mount partitions
on the Netgear Storage Central (SC101) SAN under Linux as a standard network
block device (NBD). Partitions must be managed with the Windows-only
configuration program, this tool can only mount existing partitions.

**WARNING:** There is no compatibility with Windows clients, partitions must
be formated before use, deleting all existing data.

- Usage                                                                        -

The SC101 is a storage area network (SAN) device, which differs from the more
common network attached storage (NAS) devices in that, rather than providing
file-level access to the drives over the network (via SMB, NAS, FTP, etc),
the device attaches to the kernel as if it was a local block device.

Communicating with the SC101 therefore requires specialized software, which
Netgear only provides for Windows.

sc101-nbd provides the software needed to connect an SC101 to the Linux
kernel, but the actual partitions on the SC101 will still need to be created
and managed with the official Windows configuration software.

In addition, once the partitions have been attached to the kernel, they still
need to be formatted and mounted as with any local storage device using the
standard Linux tools.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The included utility "ut" supports the following commands:

listall
    Display a listing of all discovered Netgear SC101's, along with their
IP address, firmware version, and created partitions.

attach
    Attach a partition to a NBD device node on the local machine
(i.e. /dev/nbd0). After attaching the partition, it still needs to be mounted
with the standard "mount" command.

resolve
    Display the IP address associated with a given partition ID.
